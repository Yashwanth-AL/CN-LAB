# Course Content / Syllabus

## PART-A: Implement the following using C++/Java/Python

### 1. 
A. Use appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, subnet mask, default gateway (Hint: Ipconfig). Explore different options available with the tool. B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPV4 statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using appropriate tool (hint: netstat). Explore different options available with the tool. 

### 2.
Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques. 

### 3.
Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16-bits). 

### 4.
Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm. 

### 5.
Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present. 

### 6.
Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.

### 7.
Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data. 

### 8.
Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm. 

### 9.
Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion control algorithm. 

## PART-B: Simulation Experiments using NS2/ NS3/ NetSim or any other suitable simulation software

### 10. 
Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped. 

### 11.
Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion. 

### 12.
Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination. 

### 13.
Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets. 

### 14.
Lab Test/Event
